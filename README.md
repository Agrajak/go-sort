# Go Sort

## Introduction

This is a simple sort implementation for the following sorts.
 - Selection Sort 
 - Median of three Quick Sort
 - Shell Sort
 - Bitonic Sort (w/, w/o go-routine)
 - Odd Even Merge Sort (w/, w/o go-routine)

 Using go-routines could worsen the performance of program so I made a empty channels to limit the number of go-routines

 ## To Do
